## Description
password locker is a terminal run python application that allows users to store details i.e. usernames and passwords of their various accounts.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* python3.6
* pip
* pyperclip
## BDD
These are the behaviours/features that the application implements for use by a user.

    As a user I would like:
    *To create an account with my details - log in and password
    *Store my existing login credentials
    *Generate a password for a new credential/account
    *Copy my credentials to the clipboard

## Known Bugs
Since there is no database to support the app, once you exit or log out of a session you loose all the credentials and created user. You have to create a new user for every session. You can still use the default login but if you exit the app, you will still loose all the credentials you created.
